I was the best in my class in terms of showing up to class on time, being well-behaved, getting excellent grades on classwork and examinations, and having a pleasant demeanor at school. I approach whatever I do in school and life with a cheerful attitude. After graduating from college with an associate degree in computer science and an excellent grade, I intend to transfer to the University of California or California State University to pursue a bachelor's degree in computer science or to do my OPTs, but first I'd like to work for a good tech firm for two or three years to get a good sense of what makes a good tech firm.

I'm studying flutter, a new programming language for a mobile app. I also enjoy learning about robots.
